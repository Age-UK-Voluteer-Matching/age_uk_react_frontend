This is the front end to the Age UK volunteer matching application. Currently the application is only storing data using Redux for store management. It is undecided whether to move the application full stack with Rails as an API or move it to a MERN stack with MongoDB as the database. 

To use this app, clone this repository on to your local machine, cd into the project directory and run the following commands in the terminal.:

```
$ yarn install
```

```
$ npm start
```

The yarn install will install the respective packages needed to run the application, such as the React DOM, React Router, Redux, UUID and others. 

npm start will start the development server. 

Many of the components of the app have been implmented at the time of writing this. As the app is not yet full-stack and only front end, I have opted to use dummy data in the Redux central store to imitate a database.
